    <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
    <p class="candidate-bio">
        I am a passionate and dedicated frontend developer with a strong
        foundation in web development technologies. I have a keen eye for detail
        and a commitment to delivering high-quality, user-friendly applications.
        My goal is to create seamless and engaging user experiences that make a
        positive impact on people's lives. I am always eager to learn and grow in
        my field, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills
        to a dynamic team. I am self motivated and thrive in fast-paced environments,
        where I can apply my problem-solving abilities to overcome challenges and
        deliver innovative solutions. I am confident that my technical expertise,
        creativity, and passion for frontend development make me a valuable asset
        to any organization. I am excited to take on new challenges and continue
        to grow as a developer. I am committed to delivering high-quality work and
        exceeding expectations, and I am excited about the opportunity to make
        a positive impact in the field of frontend development. My daughter is counting
         on me and she doesn't even know it XD. Yes, the pic was made using chatgpt. Oh yeah, 
        I also blog weekly about my life experiences @
         <a href="https://www.grasswasabadchoice.com" target="_blank">grasswasabadchoice.com</a>
        I am still working on it, its my first project. In my waking life i get tired of meeting people at their level, 
        so with my blogs people can meet me at my level if they want to. 
        This resume has some examples of what i can do. 
        I will come back and update it when ever a new skill is aquired. 
        I here people coin the phrase "this is chess not checkers" all the time.
        I'm playing neither. I'm playing skyrim in terms of getting all my skills
        to 100%. 
        Thank you for your time and consideration.
